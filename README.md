# MyReads Project
This project is part of the Udacity Front End Web Development nanodegree program. The HTML and CSS were already given for this project. My task was to add in react components and functionality to the app. The steps to run it are as follows:

Clone the project: git clone https://github.com/zechariahburchett/reactnd-project-myreads-starter.git
Change to the root directory: cd reactnd-project-myreads
Install the dependencies: npm install
Start the app: npm start

# App Structure
The app is laid out into multiple components. There are components for each page of the app as well as for the books and shelves used on each page. All the components can be found in the components directory.

# Search Page
The server that this application uses is provided by Udacity. Only a few keywords can be used to search effectively which can be found in SEARCH_TERMS.md
